	<p id="indexp1">
		This is a project site that allows you to help others sort their data,
		by giving up a portion of your computing power. <br>

		Your computer can be part of a bigger system, a grid computing system, that will be used to
		sort data that either other people or companies send in to us. <br> <br>

		You can do a couple of things now, if you wish to contribute, like the following:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>You can get started as a worker simply by creating a user, using the login button on the right and then
			using the create user button on the login page.</li>
		<li>If you already have a login and wish to contribute computing power, then you should also use the login
			button. </li>
		<li>If you are a customer and wish to send in data that requires sorting, use the Customer page button,
			to navigate to the customer page and upload your CSV file.</li>
	</ul>
