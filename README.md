This is our Semester Project for the second semester of Aalborg 
University's Software course. It is currently empty.

This repository is not public yet, so you probably don't have any 
questions. If, by any chance, GitHub has a security breach that allows 
people to see this repository, and one of those people are interested, 
we can maybe be contacted at cs-23-sw-2-12@student.aau.dk.
Alternatively, you can contact us at our individual emails:
