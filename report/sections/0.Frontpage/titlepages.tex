  This project report addresses the problem of sorting big-data using a grid computing system. A web-based system has been developed as a proof of concept using a combination of web-programming and sorting algorithms analysis. The developed program allows users to upload large data sets containing numeric values to be sorted and uses the divide-and-conquer strategy involving splitting of the data into buckets and distribution to worker nodes via a master node, sorting of the data in each bucket at worker nodes and writing the buckets with sorted data, into a file in the server, at the master node.
