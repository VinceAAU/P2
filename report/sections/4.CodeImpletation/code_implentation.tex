\chapter{Software Implementation}
This chapter will focus on documenting the development process of the software that was built in this project.
\\ \\
The task delegation and the general structure of creating the product, was based on the system overview (figure \ref{fig:SystemOverview}). The first focus point was the front-end part of the system, for both the worker and the customer. During this part, the server and router part of the backend was also set up. This was done in order to create a platform where the later parts of the code could be tested. After these parts were implemented and a simple site was created, the next and last part of the project was initiated, which was the master node part.

\\ \\
For a simpler overview of the implementation chapter, the parts have been split up into categories with associated subcategories:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Frontend
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Worker
        \item Customer
    \end{itemize}
    \item Backend
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Server
        \item Master
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


These are further split in their respective sections, to give an explanation of the functionalities of each of the parts in the system.

Code snippets will be shown as part of some explanations, but not all code will be shown. The code in its entirety can be found on the project's GitHub repository:
