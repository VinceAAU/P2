\section{Problem Statement} \label{sec:problemStatement}
During the problem analysis, it became obvious that the scope of the project should be limited to only one of the problems included in the initial problem statement. This means that the project will focus on time-efficient sorting of data for a grid computing system leading to the following problem statement:

\begin{center}
\emph{How can a web-based software solution be developed for time-efficient sorting of big data on a grid computing system?}
\end{center}

Validating the correctness of the result, security, authentication, and authorization will instead be secondary priorities that will enhance the quality of the product without being essential for the success of the project.
